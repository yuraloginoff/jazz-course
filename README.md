Welcome to "Jazz: The Music, the Stories, the Players." This feels a bit like welcoming an audience to a jazz gig, but on a much larger scale. I am pleased that you have joined the band. We will be listening, reading, actively participating and exchanging opinions throughout the course. I am confident that the way you hear and feel jazz will be lifted to another level.

Some of the major topics we will explore during our six weeks together:

-   What makes jazz “swing”
-   The form, feel and function of jazz
-   How musicians balance creativity and freedom with theory, form and group dynamics
-   How we engage with an art form
-   The inside story from jazz artists regarding their choice of career and life style
-   The role of jazz in America as art, entertainment and an agent of social change

Established in 1995, The Milton and Nelma Fillius Jazz Archive at Hamilton College holds a collection of videotaped interviews, numbering over 450 entries, with jazz musicians, arrangers, writers and critics. The collection generally focuses on artists associated with mainstream jazz and the swing era. Members of bands led by Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Benny Goodman, Stan Kenton and the Dorsey brothers are well represented as well as soloists and leaders of small ensembles dating from the 1930s. This oral history project was conceived by Milton F. Fillius Jr. ’44 with the support of jazz singer Joe Williams.
