# Week 1

## Week One Overview

When a musician sits down to read a jazz chart for the first time they take an overall look at the piece and gather it in. What is the groove, the form, the key and do I get a solo? An audience member may peruse the program and the stage, looking for hints about what they are about to hear. Week One of our course will set us up for the next five, presenting an audio and visual sampling of our main topics. And stay tuned about the chance to solo.

Below is an outline for the week with links to each unit.
