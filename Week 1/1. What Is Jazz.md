First, listen.

What is jazz?

For me, it is what we hear and don’t hear. There are no absolutes, but we will likely hear a sax and/or trumpet and a rhythm section. We are less likely to hear a singer. We are likely to hear a “swing” beat and less likely to hear a “straight eighth note beat.” We frequently experience a longer performance than the typical popular music cut and may be confused at times about where the song went and what the musicians are doing. We are less likely to feel the urge to get up and dance or to expect a raucous party to break out although some part of our bodies are hopefully responding. Along with applause after individual solos, the music may be accompanied by clinking glasses, conversations among the patrons and scraping chairs.

Our other senses come into play in a live jazz setting, especially in contrast to a classical concert. For many years, the distinctive aroma of cigarettes and ashtrays was part of the jazz club experience. Although smoky night clubs are now a thing of the past, we may smell food from the next table. Our sight lines are often non-existent or obscured by other patrons. Flat screen TVs may compete for our visual attention. The familiar sight of music stands in front of each musician, as with a Mozart symphony, may not be part of the picture. Our sense of touch may manifest itself in tapping feet or fingers. Nodding heads and knowing smiles may play a role in our experience with live jazz. Force of habit may assert itself as we feel the need to be holding a drink. Finally, we may realize that we are experiencing something that will never happen exactly the same way again.
